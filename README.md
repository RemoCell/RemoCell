# RemoCell

Remote cell phone (mobile) coverage data. Crowd-sourced. Always free.


## PERMANENT SCOPE

Mainstream only. Limited to:

- remote areas - excluding areas with evenly spread good enough signal coverage
- "remote-friendly" carriers - no city/metropolitan-only carriers (like Freedom Mobile in Canada)
- ground-level (or ground-accessible structures/buildings, like dams, watch towers...) - no flights/baloons/cable cars
- signal - no categorizing by roads/paths or car/biking/walking/hiking speed or accessibility
- signal strength - no speed/latency testing
- Android (for recording) - iPhone/iPad makes accessing signal strength difficult
- simple privacy (date fuzzing/delay, excluding chosen areas)
- storage on GitHub: big dataset, ongoing processing - anything else is paid for
- KML or derived CSV-like file format
- Latitude/Longitude coordinates, "standard" GPS accuracy
- cell phone (mobile) or tablets - no easy website

## LONGTERM SCOPE

- English (user interface)
- Google Maps (on Android) for reading/using
- No cellular tower data (like opencellid.org) - it doesn't help because of terrain.
- No data verification/vetting.

## MIDTERM SCOPE

- No fancy or one/integrated cell app. Many manual steps, switching between apps.
- No iPhone/iPad app (not even to read). Subscribe to a tracking issue.
- No data pruning.

## INITIAL SCOPE

- No privacy filters. Subscribe to a tracking issue.

## ROADMAP

- back-end, test units
- basic functionality
- test back-end
- privacy: fuzzing/delayed
- privacy: optional direct source (to avoid fuzzying and its delay)
- privacy: exclude "Home/Accommodation/Work..." area(s)
- per instance/installation recording sets - rather than per GitHub user: so that a group of people can use the same GitHub account
- Apple (iOS) read-only app
